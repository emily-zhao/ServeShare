# Serve Share

Serve Share is a hosting provider that lets you utilize the untapped resources all around you by allowing any user to offer up their computing power for a small fee. The user will be able to pick which computer at the price point provided by the host, and that money will directly go to the host as a benefit of Serve Share's dedicated use of the Lamden Wallet. Serve Share seeks to put the power back into the hands of the people and make web hosting services accessible to all.



How it works:

A hoster can post a transaction to set a price for their service, the address they are hosting on is also saved on the ledger. Another user can then purchase their offer. When they do so, the price of the offer is transferred from their credit to the hoster and their public key is added to the offer so that the hoster can verify their purchase.



**Serve Share** is brought to you by WƎ ΛI, a group of juniors majoring in Computer Science from Cleveland State University. Serve Share has been created for the 2020 Hack OHI/O hackathon.



We entered this hackathon, interested in learning more about fields of computer science that our classes had not previously looked into. We were excited to find the Lamden challenge asked us to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts. Thanks to this challenge, we were able to become fully immersed in the finer workings of smart contracts. This hackathon experience has been truly great because this challenge really tested our limits in what we can achieve!
