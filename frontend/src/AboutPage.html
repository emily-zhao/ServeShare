                      <b>Serve Share</b> is a hosting provider that lets you utilize the untapped resources all around you by allowing any user to offer up their
                      computing power for a small fee. The user will be able to pick which computer at the price point provided by the host, and that money
                      will directly go to the host as a benefit of Serve Share's dedicated use of the Lamden Wallet. <b>Serve Share</b> seeks to put the power back
                      into the hands of the people and make web hosting services accessible to all.
